##### The Contributor Covenant and its children

[The Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) was written as a boiler plate document written to foster a healthy and safe open source community in the world. It was written in a way to establish common, shared values for projects to adopt, while leaving some space for each project to adapt the Covenant to its unique community and values. It cannot solely prevent toxicity and conflict in a project's community, and a project's leadership is finally responsible for that.
