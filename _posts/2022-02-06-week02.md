##### What is the Code of Conduct?

The code of conduct is the guidance document for the people that choose become members of the community. How should members behave when interacting with each other in this project environment. Some projects might be more explicit than others, but in general people are required to be courteous to each other.

##### The Contributor Covenant and its children

[The Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) was written as a boiler plate document written to foster a healthy and safe open source community in the world. It was written in a way to establish common, shared values for projects to adopt, while leaving some space for each project to adapt the Covenant to its unique community and values. It cannot solely prevent toxicity and conflict in a project's community, and a project's leadership is finally responsible for that. 

###### 2 Different adaptations of the Contriutor Covenant
* The Go Project - [Here is the link to their Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct). They used the Contributor Covenant as a boiler plate and add much more detail to it. There are a lot of words like 'constructive,' 'responsible,' 'respectful,' etc. that are open to interpretation but they have provided much more detail about them to avoid any confusion! It also encourages members to resolve conflicts among themselves before bringing it to their attention. They also extended the scope of the document to cover even conversations about the project.
  * I think that they have done a great job but extending the original document and adapting it to their needs and uses. To make their community even safer and more welcoming. 
* Eclipse - [Here is the link to their Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php). Their Code of Conduct is almost identical to the Contributor Covenant. Even though it is a good standard to base it off of, I think that it is only effective if you modify it to address your community. With no changes to the document it doesn't make it a bad thing, but it could have been much better!
