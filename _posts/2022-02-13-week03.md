##### Git refresher and activity

This week we covered the basics of Git through an activity during class. Before this activity, I considered myself an intermediate at Git and I think this activity was definitely something I needed to refresh my memory and actualy learn a couple of things I hadn't done before. Specifically, I think the fork and upstream activities were the most challenging and were relatively new for me.

###### Finally figuring out non-conflict merging

One of the biggest questions I had was about dealing with bigger code bases where there are many people working on different parts of the code at the same time. For example, if there are 20 files in a repository and 7 people are working on it. One possible scenario is - let's say that all 7 people are working on completely seperate files and are being good about not editing anything else. How do you pull from the master branch and not lose all the work that is saved on your local machine?

Apparently, GitHub is smart enough to know the difference between the work you did on the local repository and the different changes that were made on the master branch. The steps that you should take are - add changes -> commit changes with meaningful message -> pull -> push. 

Although this is pretty simple and I have myself successfully done this in the past, but I never really know why and how this works and never seemed to grasp the concept. 

This was actually the first time it was absolutely clear for me and honestly, made me feel much better about all the trauma I have gone through in the past :)


###### Adding another remote and using Upstream 

In the above scenario described above there is actually another layer. To be able to manage the version of the main codebase that you forked and to make changes on that and track any changes made to the main codebase, you have to add another remote and use upstream. 

This was something I have never used and just realized that it is actually incredibly useful, specially in the context on open source projects. For actual open source projects there are thousands of people using them and hundreds of people contributing to them. I think it is going to come in very handy with the main project we decide to work on for the rest of the semester.
