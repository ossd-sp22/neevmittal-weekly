Some information about you!

### My Fields of Study

I'm a senior studying Computer Science at New York University, and I am also completing minors in Math, Economics and Business Studies. 

Even though I am studying CS as my major, I am not planning to go into software development/engineering as my career choice. I feel that CS hads taught me fundamental skills that are going to be applicable in all I do, while helping me stay relevant in this tech-heavy world. 

Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neev-mittal/), please feel free to connect with me.


### My Extra curricular activities

About 2 years, I founded a company with 3 other friends who are students at Boston University. It is called CoStudy and it is an edTech tool for higher education. The problem we're solving is in collaborative learning settings (like group projects), where we are enhancing soft skill learning (like communication, teamwork, conflict resolution) for students, and making it an easier administration of group projects for professors while enabling fair grading. 

I love to talk to students and professors about this project and get some feedback on it. I am happy to show anybody the platform and answer any questions!
