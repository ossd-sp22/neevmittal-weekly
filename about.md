### My Fields of Study

I'm a senior studying Computer Science at New York University, and I am also completing minors in Math, Economics and Business Studies. 

Even though I am studying CS as my major, I am not planning to go into software development/engineering as my career choice. I feel that CS hads taught me fundamental skills that are going to be applicable in all I do, while helping me stay relevant in this tech-heavy world.
